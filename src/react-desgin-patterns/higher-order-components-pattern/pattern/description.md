### **6. Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**

#### Description:

A higher-order component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new enhanced component by injecting additional props or behavior.

#### Benefits:

- Enables reusability of logic across components.
- Enhances components without modifying their source code.
- Supports separation of concerns by wrapping components.

#### Example in Real Tools:

- **Redux's `connect`:** A HOC that connects React components to the Redux store.
