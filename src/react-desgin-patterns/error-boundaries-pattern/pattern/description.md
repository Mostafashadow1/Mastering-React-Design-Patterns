### **5. Error Boundaries Pattern**

#### Description:

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their subtree, log them, and display fallback UIs instead of crashing the app.

#### Benefits:

- Prevents crashes by isolating errors.
- Improves user experience by displaying friendly error messages.
- Centralizes error handling for specific UI sections.

#### Example in Real Tools:

- **Sentry:** Works with React's error boundaries to track and log frontend errors.
